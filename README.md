Project Background
This is a milestone project. It is first project assigment from General Assembly Software and the first game app I've build with html, css and java script

Design Ideas
- Simple and entertaining tic tac toe game that can be accessed by user through mobile device. 
- Integrate Giphy (https://developers.giphy.com/) library so user can select a laughing gif as 'braging' rights

Approach
- Write psedocode
- Do tutorials
- Proritize project requirements

Challanges
- Where to start when designing a game / solving a problem
- Time consuming effort

Things I learn:


Bugs
- human player can click box that already been selected by computer

Basic feature in progress
- show 'draw' message when all boxes have been selected
- reset button 
- placement of winning message

Advance feature to be implemented
- button to select animated laughter gif
- integrate giphy library
- update the look and feel (css)
