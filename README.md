Project Background
This is a milestone project. It is first project assigment from General Assembly Software and the first game app I've build with html, css and java script

Design Ideas
- Simple and entertaining tic tac toe game that can be accessed by user through mobile device. 
- Integrate Giphy (https://developers.giphy.com/) library so user can select a laughing gif as 'braging' rights

Approach
- Write psedocode
- Do tutorials
- Proritize project requirements

Challanges
- Where to start when designing a game / solving a problem
- Time consuming effort
